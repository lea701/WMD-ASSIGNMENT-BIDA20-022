                      <h2 >LIFESTYLE IN ETHEKWINI</h2>
                      <p>The way of life in DURBAN aka ETHEKWINI is more urban yet cultural.People who hail from there are very true to their roots.
                        Most of them are of the Zulu tribe so they still abide by what their ancestors left behind.Even their City is found in a PROVINCE called Kwa Zulu Natal.
                        As for their urban traits they take strolls ,do jogs zip line at Moses Mabhida  Visit the Aquarium in USHAKA MARINE World   or maybe go Surfing at the ocean at times play beach volleyball   </p></div>
